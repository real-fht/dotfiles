# `modules/animation` Custom Animation module for AwesomeWM.

This module is mainly stolen and reimplemented from [Kasper24/KwesomeDE](https://github.com/Kasper24/KwesomeDE), since they know way better than me in AwesomeWM configuration.

## What does this includes?

- Tweening for number values, either since values or inside tables.
- Different builtin easings (See file: `./tween.lua`, line: 357)

## Why would I chose this over something like [`andOrlando/rubato`](https://github.com/andOrlando/rubato)?
